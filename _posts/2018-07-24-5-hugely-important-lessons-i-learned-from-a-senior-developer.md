> You can't just do the same projects as everyone else. You have to do something *different* to stand out and be noticed.

I'm not much of a networking kind of guy. I was in sales for a little while and I think it ruined the concept for me. You learn (most) everyone is just out for how they can get ahead and not actually interested in building a relationship.

So when my wife told me she got the details of two guys who own a web development firm, and that I should contact them, I flinched a bit. 

You see, I've recently decided to get serious about my career and follow my passion for coding and web development. And for someone who dislikes - in general - contact with other people, it's a career that suits my personality well.

But, alas, the fact remains that networking and connecting with real human beings is still by far the best and quickest way to accelerate your career and achieve your goals. 

So (after apologizing to my wife who was right - again...) I got in touch with these guys and they not only responded but set me up with their lead developer and hiring manager. Nice.

I met him for coffee one afternoon and as well as it being a thoroughly enjoyable experience, he imparted some serious wisdom about becoming a developer on me that I felt complelled to share.

From what skills web companies really look for in new developers to when the best time to start applying for jobs, here is what I learned from that meeting.

## 1) Learn about the software life cycle process

First off, he hit me with some hard truth about working in a real firm. On a typical week you will spend only *2 days* coding. The other 3 days are spent in the development planning process (in their case [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) development). 

This process includes meetings with the team, determining estimates, reviewing past work, and so on as the project progresses through a "sprint" (a 1-4 week period dedicated to producing a concrete outcome). 

He said this can be tough for new people who come from coding all the time. Instead you now have to be in meetings and planning sessions most of the time. However, learning the skills of communication, working well in a team, and thinking about the bigger business process is critical to succeeding in this type of industry. 

Because at the end of the day it's about shipping a final product, not what you would rather work on all day.

Learning this process and becoming engaged in it as a new developer is a sure-fire way to attract the right kind of attention. It's one of the top traits he looks for in new hires.

## 2) To stand out build your credibility

After you graduate from college, or a coding bootcamp, or reach a certain level of skill as a self-taught developer, you will be one of (a growing) number of new developers out there. You **have to stand out** and be different from everyone else who has done the same projects. 

So how do you go beyond being the millionth person to make a reddit clone? Here's what he shared with me:
- **Work on open-source projects**
  
  The best way to start is fixing easy bugs or adding documentation. He said every project needs better documentation and it is an easy way to contribute when starting out. I found a good site designed to help ‘newbies’ get started with this here: [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)


- **Make your portfolio stand out with unique projects**
  
  Your projects need to be distinct from everyone else's and showcase what you’re capable of (other than following directions). 
  
  The easiest way to do that? **Make something you'd use**. Have a special diet and need a shopping list? Create a recipe app that automatically creates a shopping list based on the menu for the week. It's easy to stay motivated when you care about the outcome.

## 3) Get involved in the community
